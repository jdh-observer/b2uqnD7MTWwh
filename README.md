## Abstract

The *Bibliotheca Eugeniana* (BE), the personal library of Prince Eugene of Savoy, was merged into today’s Austrian National Library after his death—without detailed documentation of the items incorporated or their subsequent dispersal within the larger holdings. As a result, the boundaries and internal structure of the historical collection became obscured over time, making it difficult to identify and study the original assembly. The project *Bibliotheca Eugeniana Digital* applied digital humanities methods to make this dispersed collection accessible in a new way. Among other approaches, we developed a string-matching algorithm to link the historical inventory of the collection with bibliographical records from the Austrian National Library's modern catalog—a process described in detail in this article. The outcomes of the project include a digital edition of the historical catalog, enriched with links to modern bibliographic data, supplementary metadata, and a visual interface enabling the exploration of the reconstructed collection.
